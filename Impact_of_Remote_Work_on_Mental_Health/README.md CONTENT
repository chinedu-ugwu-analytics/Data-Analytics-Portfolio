# Impact of Remote Work on Mental Health

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how different work modes (Remote, Hybrid, and Onsite) impact employees’ mental health, stress levels, productivity, and overall well-being across various industries and regions.

## Problem Statement
With the rise of remote work, organizations need to understand how work location affects employees’ mental health and performance. This analysis helps identify key mental health risks and factors influencing employee satisfaction and productivity.

## Tools Used
- Excel
- Pivot tables

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains employee-level data including:
- Demographics (Age, Gender, Region)
- Job details (Industry, Job Role, Career Level)
- Work arrangement (Remote, Hybrid, Onsite)
- Mental health indicators (Stress Level, Mental Health Risk, Sleep Quality)
- Productivity and work-life balance ratings

Total Records: 5,000 employees  
Total Features: 24 columns

## Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analysis of mental health risk by work location
- Comparison of stress levels, productivity, and work-life balance
- Visualization of key insights using charts and dashboards

## Key Insights
- Remote workers show higher flexibility but increased social isolation in some regions
- Hybrid workers report better work-life balance on average
- High stress levels correlate with poor sleep quality and lower productivity
- Company support significantly reduces mental health risk

## Conclusion
The analysis shows that while remote work offers flexibility, mental health outcomes depend heavily on company support, workload balance, and access to mental health resources. Organizations should adopt hybrid strategies and improve support systems to enhance employee well-being and productivity.
